> From the very beginning of CSS, there has been a giant, layout-shaped hole at its center. We filled it with <span>table markup</span>, which was never meant for layout. After that came <span>floats</span>, which were also <span>never meant for layout</span>; we only used them because `clear` existed, so we could push footers to the bottom of the page.
