* All elements contained within a given element are said to be its .red-text[descendants].
* An element that's directly contained within another element is said to be a .red-text[child] of that element.
* The containing element is the .red-text[parent].
* All elements higher up than a particular element in the tree are its .red-text[ancestors].
* Two elements with the same parent are .red-text[siblings].
